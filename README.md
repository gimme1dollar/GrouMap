# GrouMap
SLAM (based-on EKF) with SWARM

## Algorithm (Concept)
### Robot (Simulation)
- State estimation based on linear/angular velocity
- Landmark distance (probabilistic) measure
- EKF SLAM : referred from https://jinyongjeong.github.io/images/post/SLAM/lec05_EKF_SLAM/EKF.pdf

### Hub Control
- Map plotting 
- Commanding based on explored map situation and robot' poistions

## Result
### Single Robot Simulation
